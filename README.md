## What‚Äôs the difference between extensions and plugins?
Extensions are lightweight add-ons installed directly from a browser‚Äôs official store (like Chrome Web Store) to enhance or modify browser functionality‚Äîsuch as ad-blockers, password managers, or productivity tools. They run within the browser environment and are sandboxed for security. Plugins, on the other hand, were external software components used in older browsers to render special types of web content like Flash or Java Applets. Plugins required separate installation and often had deeper system access, making them more vulnerable to security risks. Most modern browsers have now phased out plugin support in favor of safer and more controlled extensions.

## Conclusion: Extensions are safe browser add-ons when vetted, whereas plugins are older technologies now mostly phased out due to security concerns.
